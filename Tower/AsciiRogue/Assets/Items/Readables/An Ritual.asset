    note that has seen better days. The fading words, which you can barely make out,
    read:\n<i>Place these four lights around the body of the fallen. Let flame consume
    their mortal vessel,\r let the blaze reduce them all to ashes, and let there
    be light. Fall to your knees, unworthy, and pray! Pray that your God would take
    pity on you and send proof of his might. His unseen\r Finger of Death that stalks
    the heavens and strikes fear into even the other Gods.\r</i>\n<color=#a38745>===========================================================================================</color>"
