  text: "<color=#a38745>===========================================================================================</color>\n<i>I
    stumbled across a strange yet enchanting medallion. I couldn't resist putting
    it on. Not long\r after I had my first brush with death. The enemy's blade gleamed
    as it lunged for my neck but\r somehow found the face of the medallion. It shattered
    upon contact in a bright yellow glow\r and vanquished the enemy before me. My
    wounds began to heal and my pain disappeared as\r I was filled with a new vigour.
    With this I could reach the end and survive another day more.\r</i>\n<color=#a38745>===========================================================================================</color>"
