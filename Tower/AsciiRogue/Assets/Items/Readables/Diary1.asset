  text: "<i><b>Journey to the Dreamland #1</b>\r\nWhen I turned around the path had
    already disappeared. I was stranded... The cold crept into\r my bones and the
    darkness was like a living thing, coiling and winding itself around me...\r This
    is a land of nightmares... My feet crunch upon bone with every step I take but
    this does\r not unnerve me anymore. The sound that truly rattles me to my core
    is the constant\r whispering at my ear. They tell me I am lost, that I will die
    here unknown and forgotten. At\r first I fought and denied them but now I know
    their words to be true. This was never what I\r wanted. I shouldn't have come.
    I shouldn't have come...</i> ~ <b>J.</b>"
